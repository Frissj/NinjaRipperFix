### **Perfect Alignment for Ninja Ripper & Remix**

Ninja Ripper is a tool that is able to rip meshes with shader transformations and import them into blender. However the meshes are scaled and rotated which makes them unusable. This Blender addon solves the problem by using a single remix mesh which is in both captures to find the correct transformations needed to fix the entire Ninja Ripper capture/s.

### âœ¨ **Key Features:**

* **Automatic Alignment:**
  Precisely align multiple Ninja Ripper captures to your Remix reference with minimal manual intervention.

* **Batch Processing:**
  Rapidly handle large numbers of meshes across multiple captures simultaneously, optimizing your workflow and saving valuable time.

* **Duplicate Detection & Removal:**
  Intelligently detect and safely remove duplicate meshes based on geometry, location, and material rules. Never lose important custom materials again.

* **Non-Uniform Affine Transforms:**
  Effortlessly manage and apply complex scaling, rotation, and translation transformations for perfect capture matches.

* **Efficient Caching & Speed Optimization:**
  Built-in caching of geometry evaluations, KD-trees, and texture hashes dramatically boosts performance for repetitive tasks.

* **Easy Capture Management:**
  Quickly add, remove, and track captures within Blender, streamlining large-scale asset workflows.

* **Persistent Storage:**
  Stores alignment settings directly alongside your `.blend` files for hassle-free future sessions.

* **Debugging and Verbose Logs:**
  Comprehensive debug output ensures transparency and easier troubleshooting during alignment and duplicate removal.
